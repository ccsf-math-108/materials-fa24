    "California has laws in place to help govern how much an employee should be paid for overtime work. Visit the [Labor Commissioner's Office FAQ about Overtime](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_overtime.htm) if you are curious about these laws. There could be several reasons for why an employee works overtime. Some are healthy reasons and some are not. The ratio of overtime compensation to total compensation can provide a signal for health of departments and their employees. According to [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/working-overtime), here are some potential disadvantages of working extra hours:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Focus loss**: You will likely want to take breaks while working overtime, and you may lose focus and productivity naturally as your working hours increase. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Safety and health risk**: Working longer hours also can be dangerous, depending on the job. Working overtime regularly can also disrupt your work-life balance, lead to burnout or create health risks, such as sitting at a computer for long periods. Due to these risks, more companies are limiting the number of hours worked in certain positions, such as truck drivers. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Less work-life balance**: There are only 24 hours in the day, and working overtime reduces the time for a good work-life balance. More work hours mean fewer hours for family, relaxation and sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, here are some potential advantages for working extra hours:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Extra money**: Working overtime means you earn extra money for extra hours, usually 1.5 to two times your hourly rate. Overtime pay could allow you to bulk up your salary and have more money for living expenses, vacations or savings. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Career boost**: Working overtime may also help advance your career‚Äîand potential earnings‚Äîby proving you‚Äôre reliable and motivated in your role. Volunteering to work extra hours shows your current employer that you‚Äôre dedicated to doing a good job. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Gain experience**: Overtime is an opportunity to gain job experience and polish your skills. Typically, the more you work at something, the better you become."

    "One way to analyze overtime work for San Francisco employees is to consider the overtime pay values in the data set, but these values are relative to the amount of money the employee makes. To account for this you could consider overtime pay for an employee as a quantity relative to that employee's salary. This would allow you to compare these ratios for all the employees. Specifically, use the measurement called the overtime ratio defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Overtime Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Overtime Pay}}{\\text{Salary}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many special cases, when it comes to overtime pay, that might make analyzing this ratio in general challenging. So, to keep things more simple, narrow your focus to employees that make at least a certain salary. Let that base salary reflect working 40 hrs per week for 52 weeks at the minimum wage of the time, 16.99 dollars per hour."
